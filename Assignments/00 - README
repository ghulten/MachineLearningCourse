If you're in CSEP 546, please go to canvas for the official version of these 
assignments (which might be a little bit different than what is here). And please
submit your answers via canvas.

You can find the getting started documentation in the root of the repository: MachineLearningCourse/GettingStarted.pdf. This contains detailed information\
on setting up the python environment for the assignments.

The reading assignments are in these two books:

Machine Learning by Mitchell -- http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/mlbook.html
Building Intelligent Systems by Hulten -- http://intelligentsystem.io/book.html

The assignments are grouped into modules that are each centered around a theme.

Module 1 - The Basics with Logistic Regression

This module teaches the basics of doing machine learning: going from simple models to a well-used professional 
 modeling tool - logistic regression and exploring the model evaluation and optimization process along the way.
 It uses a SMS spam domain to illustrate concepts with a realistic example.

Module 2 - Bias and Variance with Ensembles

This module builds on Module 1 to explore more advanced concepts in modeling. 

Module 3 - Neural Networks

Module 4 - Reinforcement Learning
