Open SupportCode\Framework-3-LogisticRegression.py. 

Complete the implementation of LogisticRegression using the stub referenced from the framework. 
Note that the framework provides a small test case with some visualizations to help you debug.

Use a threshold of 0.5 for classification (if score for a sample after the sigmoid is > 0.5 it is classified as 1 (in this case, that's spam)).

Use gradient descent for optimization as outlined in the framework code.

HAND IN:

1 Point --

The visualization of the model learned on the UnitTest using 10 iterations of gradient descent, stepSize=1.0, convergence=0.005. (Not the model weights!)

2 Points –

Hand in your completed LogisticRegression.py & EvaluateBinaryProbabilityEstimate.py. Make sure they are clear. 
If the TA has a hard time finding and spot-checking the key components (e.g. gradient calculation in __gradientDescentStep, 
the logic in incrementalFit, and loss calculation) they will have to deduct credit.

1 Point –

Tune the hyperparameter ‘convergence’ by trying [ 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, 0.00001 ] (with stepSize of 1.0). Produce a table showing:

<convergence parameter>, <steps to convergence>, <validation set accuracy>

for each setting of the convergence hyperparameter.

1 Point – 

Describe in 2-3 sentences your interpretation of the output of this hyperparameter sweep. Include a justification for trying more values of the 'convergence' hyperparameter
  or stopping there. If you do think you should try more parameters, what is the next one you would try?

1 Point – 

Produce a plot showing the training set loss and the validation set loss every 100 steps during the run 
 with the best convergence value you found in the parameter sweep and stepSize of 1.0. In no more than 100
 words describe the difference between the training and validation loss. Turn in the plot and answer the following:
 Which set does the model have better loss on? Why?
