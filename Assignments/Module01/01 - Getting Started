You will need to set up your environment prepare for later assignments. This involves installing the relevant 
  tools and running the sample code on sample data.

First, get familiar with python 3.x: https://www.learnpython.org/

No way Python!?!?

Python is widely used in machine learning and data science to process, prepare, & explore data; and to stitch 
  together ML tools into experiments/work flows. Keep in mind that we are only going to be programming very basic
  versions of the various algorithms, and there will be very little need for optimization. You don't have to be 
  a python expert to complete these assignments.

I provide python framework code to get you started on the assignments, deal with data loading, etc.
 
Look in the GettingStarted documentation (MachineLearningCourse/GettingStarted.pdf) for help setting up your environment & downloading the course’s framework code.
 
Execute SupportCode\Framework-1-GettingStarted.py in your python environment. Explore the code a bit too.

HAND IN:

1 point --

The accuracy of the ‘ModelMostCommon’ model when trained on the training data and evaluated on the validation data.
