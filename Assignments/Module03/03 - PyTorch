Install PyTorch and open SupportCode/Framework-3-PyTorch.py 

Run the framework. Update the sample neural network to implement the two hidden layer version of the network you tuned in the 
 previous assignment and tune it to give similar accuracy results.

Compare the PyTorch version to the version you implemented.

Hand In:

1 Point -- Your updated BlinkNeuralNetwork.py file.

3 Point -- Two charts and less than two hundred words describing your comparison. Did the models
    converge similarly? Did they generalize similarly? What differences remain between the implementations?
    How much does randomization affect the PyTorch run (vs your implementation where the framework set
    a seed)?
