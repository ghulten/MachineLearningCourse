Tune your best model for the Adult data set.

Reuse your results from previous assignments (the hyperparameters you found for logistic regression
   and for decision trees), and add in Boosted Trees.

Use numeric features if they make your models better.

HAND IN - 

6 points - A short writeup describing the tuning process. The bare minimum text to clearly
    indicate the following elements so the TA can find the required pieces and verify they
    were done correctly.

Include at least one chart shwoing a parameter sweep demonstrating tuning boosted trees.

Include an ROC curve of the best verions of logistic regression, decision trees,
     and boosted trees you found when trained on the full training set and evaluated
     on the test data.

Include the parameter settings and accuracy of those three best models -- and error bounds.
